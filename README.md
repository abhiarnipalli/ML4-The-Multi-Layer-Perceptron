# Multi-Layer Perceptron for US Census Data Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation and evaluation of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for a classification task using the US Census dataset available on Kaggle. The primary objective is to convert a regression problem into a four-level classification task and compare various MLP implementations in terms of performance. The project aims to understand how different MLP architectures can be optimized for classification tasks and the impact of adaptive learning techniques on model performance.

## Introduction
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are a class of feedforward artificial neural networks used for various machine learning tasks. In this project, we apply MLPs to a classification task using the US Census dataset. The goal is to convert the original regression problem into a four-level classification task and compare the performance of different MLP implementations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the US Census dataset available on Kaggle. It contains various demographic and income-related features. The original regression problem is transformed into a classification task with four levels.


## Results
The performance comparison of different MLP models is documented in the `results/performance_comparison.csv` file. The accuracy plots for the models are available in the `results/model_accuracy_plots.png` file.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Multi-Layer Perceptrons for a classification task using the US Census dataset. By converting a regression problem into a four-level classification task, we explore the performance of different MLP implementations. The results highlight the impact of adaptive learning techniques and model architecture on classification performance.
